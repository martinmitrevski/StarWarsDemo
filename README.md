# StarWarsDemo
Demo app using the StarWarsSDK.

## Installation

You can add the Star Wars SDK as a Swift package. Open your project, go to XCode -> File -> Swift Packages -> Add Package dependency.

Insert the following url: https://github.com/martinmitrevski/StarWarsSDK.git and set the dependency to master (since the SDK is still in development).
